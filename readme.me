Write a brief introduction about the project in the README.md file.
Step 2: Add a LICENSE file to the repository
Create a LICENSE file in the root directory of the ScreenNamePlus1/Battleship repository.

Follow-up Steps

Verify the README and LICENSE files appear correctly on the GitHub repository page.
Would you like me to assist you with creating specific content for the README or choosing a license type?

Yes I need you to do both of those but first I need more details about what buttons to push on the dropdown menu to add a file to an existing repository. These buttons are confusing.

 # Battleship Game (Local Two-Player)

This is a Python implementation of the classic Battleship game, where two players take turns on the same computer.

## How to Play

1.  **Run the Game:**
    * Open a terminal or command prompt.
    * Navigate to the directory containing the `battleship.py` file.
    * Run the script: `python battleship.py`

2.  **Player 1 Place Ships:**
    * Player 1 will be prompted to place their ships on the board.
    * Follow the on-screen instructions to enter coordinates and orientations for each ship.

    * Valid orientations: H (horizontal) or V (vertical).
    * Valid coordinates: A1 - J10.

3.  **Player 2 Place Ships:**
    * Player 2 will then be prompted to place their ships on their board.

4.  **Take Turns:**
    * Players take turns guessing the coordinates of their opponent's ships.
    * Enter the coordinates of your shot (e.g., A5).
    * The game will indicate whether your shot was a hit or a miss.
    * If a ship is sunk, the game will announce which ship was sunk.

5.  **Win Condition:**
    * The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.

6.  **Quitting**
    * Entering "Q" at the coordinates prompt will exit the game.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* No external libraries are required (uses the standard `os` and `random` libraries).

## Notes

* This is a local two-player game, with players taking turns on the same computer.
* The game provides basic input validation.
* The game board is displayed in the terminal.

## Future Improvements

* Graphical user interface (GUI).
* Ability to save and load games.
* More robust error handling.
* Refined game logic and user interface.

## Image Creation Tips:

1.  **Screenshots:** Take screenshots of your game at various stages (server setup, client connection, ship placement, gameplay, victory).
2.  **Graphics Software:** Use image editing software (like GIMP, Photoshop, or online tools like Canva) to create a game logo or other graphical elements.
3.  **Image Hosting:** Host your images on a platform like Imgur, GitHub Pages, or a personal website.
4.  **Replace Placeholders:** Update the `path/to/your_image.png` placeholders in the README with the actual URLs of your hosted images.

By adding images, you can make your README much more engaging and user-friendly.

# Battleship Game

## Overview
This is an enhanced implementation of the classic **Battleship** game written in Python. The game supports both local two-player mode and networked multiplayer mode, allowing players to compete either on the same computer or over a network. The game features a clean console-based interface, ship placement validation, and robust network communication for multiplayer functionality.

## Features
- **Local Two-Player Mode**: Two players take turns on the same computer, placing ships and firing shots.
- **Network Multiplayer Mode**: Players can host or join a game over a network to play against opponents on different machines.
- **Interactive Ship Placement**: Players manually place ships with validation to ensure valid placements.
- **Game Board Visualization**: Clear console-based board display with hits ('X'), misses ('O'), and hidden ships.
- **Robust Network Handling**: Uses TCP sockets for reliable communication with proper error handling and connection timeouts.
- **Quit Option**: Players can quit at any time during ship placement or gameplay.
- **Ship Status Tracking**: Tracks hits and sunk ships, with immediate feedback to players.

## Game Rules
- The game is played on a 10x10 grid.
- Each player has a fleet of 5 ships:
  - Carrier (5 units)
  - Battleship (4 units)
  - Cruiser (3 units)
  - Submarine (3 units)
  - Destroyer (2 units)
- Players place their ships either horizontally ('H') or vertically ('V') on their board.
- Players take turns firing shots at coordinates (e.g., A5).
- A hit is marked with 'X', a miss with 'O'. If a ship is fully hit, it is considered sunk.
- The game ends when one player's fleet is completely sunk.

## Requirements
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Network**: For network mode, ensure both players are on the same network or have proper port forwarding set up (port 12345 is used by default).

No additional libraries are required, as the game uses only Python's standard library (`os`, `socket`, `json`, `threading`, `time`, and `typing`).

## Installation
1. **Clone or Download the Code**:
   - Clone the repository or download the `battleship.py` file to your local machine.
2. **Ensure Python is Installed**:
   - Verify Python is installed by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.
3. **Run the Game**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing the `battleship.py` file.
   - Run the game using:
     ```bash
     python battleship.py
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     python3 battleship.py
     ```

## How to Play
1. **Launch the Game**:
   - Run the script, and the main menu will appear with four options:
     - **1. Local Two-Player Game**: Play with another person on the same computer.
     - **2. Network Multiplayer (Host)**: Host a game and wait for an opponent to connect.
     - **3. Network Multiplayer (Join)**: Connect to a hosted game using the server's IP address.
     - **4. Exit**: Quit the game.

2. **Local Two-Player Mode**:
   - **Ship Placement**:
     - Each player takes turns placing their ships on their 10x10 board.
     - Enter coordinates (e.g., A5) and orientation (H for horizontal, V for vertical).
     - The game ensures valid placements and shows available placement options.
   - **Gameplay**:
     - Players alternate turns firing shots by entering coordinates (e.g., A5).
     - Feedback is provided for hits, misses, and sunk ships.
     - The game continues until one player's fleet is sunk.
     - Enter 'Q' to quit at any time.

3. **Network Multiplayer Mode**:
   - **Hosting a Game**:
     - Select option 2 to start a server.
     - The game displays your local IP address and waits for an opponent to connect.
     - Share your IP address with the opponent.
   - **Joining a Game**:
     - Select option 3 and enter the host's IP address.
     - The game attempts to connect to the server.
   - **Gameplay**:
     - Similar to local mode, but shots and results are sent over the network.
     - The host goes first, and players alternate turns.
     - The game handles network disconnections gracefully and notifies players if the opponent quits.

4. **Quitting**:
   - During ship placement or gameplay, enter 'Q' to quit.
   - In network mode, quitting notifies the opponent.

## Controls
- **Input Coordinates**: Use the format `A5` (column letter A-J, row number 1-10).
- **Orientation**: Enter `H` for horizontal or `V` for vertical during ship placement.
- **Quit**: Enter `Q` to quit during coordinate input.
- **Continue**: Press Enter to proceed after each turn or message.

## Network Setup Notes
- **Port**: The game uses port 12345 by default. Ensure this port is open on your firewall for network play.
- **Local Network**: For network mode, both players should be on the same local network, or the host must configure port forwarding for external connections.
- **Timeouts**: The game includes timeouts (30 seconds for gameplay, 10 seconds for connection attempts) to prevent hanging on network issues.
- **IP Address**: When hosting, share the displayed IP address with your opponent. When joining, ensure the IP address is correct.

## Example Gameplay
### Local Mode
1. Player 1 places their ships:
   ```
   Place your Carrier (size 5).
   Available placements:
     A1 H, A1 V, B1 H, B1 V, ...
   Enter coordinates (e.g., A5, or Q to quit): A1
   Enter orientation (H for horizontal, V for vertical): H
   ‚úÖ Carrier placed successfully!
   ```
2. Players take turns firing shots:
   ```
   --- Player 1's Turn ---
   Your shots:
     A B C D E F G H I J
   1 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
   2 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
   ...
   Enter coordinates (e.g., A5, or Q to quit): B3
   üí• Hit!
   ```

### Network Mode
1. Host starts the server:
   ```
   üåê Server started on 192.168.1.100:12345
   Waiting for opponent to connect...
   ‚úÖ Connected to opponent from 192.168.1.101
   ```
2. Client connects:
   ```
   Enter server IP address (or 'back' to return): 192.168.1.100
   ‚úÖ Connected to server!
   ```
3. Gameplay proceeds similarly to local mode, with shots exchanged over the network.

## Error Handling
- **Invalid Input**: The game validates all inputs (coordinates, orientation) and prompts for corrections.
- **Network Errors**: Connection issues, timeouts, or opponent disconnections are handled with appropriate error messages.
- **Unexpected Errors**: The game catches unexpected errors and exits gracefully, prompting the user to restart.

## Limitations
- No graphical user interface (GUI); the game is console-based.
- Network play requires manual IP address entry and proper network configuration.
- No AI opponent; both local and network modes require two human players.
- No save/load game functionality.

## Future Improvements
- Add an AI opponent for single-player mode.
- Implement a graphical interface using a library like Pygame or Tkinter.
- Add support for saving and loading game states.
- Enhance network play with a lobby system or matchmaking.
- Allow customizable board sizes and ship configurations.

## Troubleshooting
- **Connection Issues**: Ensure both players are on the same network, the port (12345) is open, and the correct IP address is used.
- **Input Errors**: Follow the exact format for coordinates (e.g., A5) and orientation (H or V).
- **Game Crashes**: If the game crashes, restart it and check for network stability or input errors.
